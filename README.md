## Problem description


You are building a tennis game scorer that will eventually be used on the Wimbledon website to show live scores.

### Rules

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "love", "fifteen", "thirty", and "forty" respectively.

3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".

4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.

5. The serving player's score is always first, the receiving player's score is second.

### Interface

The interface to our tennis game looks like this (shown in Ruby):

```ruby
server = "Player 1"
receiver = "Player 2"
game = Game.new(server, receiver)
game.point_to(server)
game.point_to(receiver)
score = game.score()
```

### Tasks

Your goal is to implement the Game class, so that it will
calculate scores correctly for the test data provided below.

It will be used as a library by other parts of the system, so it
doesn't need to deal with input or output, it will just be called
using the interface shown above (or an equivalent in your language of
choice).

First discuss the problem with your programming pair. What would be
your first step? How will you check that you've implemented the
Game class correctly?

When you've agreed a plan, go ahead and implement.

### Test data

Server: J
Receiver: B

Points won: J,J,B,J
Score: Forty, fifteen

Points won: J,B,J,B,J,B,B
Score: Advantage, B

Points won: J,J,J,B,B,B,B,B
Score: Game, B
